# BMI Calculator
![Project Img](/maxresdefault.jpg)

I am a high school student, and lately, I have been under a lot of academic pressure due to the upcoming promotion to the second year of high school. As a result, I have been spending a lot of time dealing with schoolwork and attending tutoring sessions, which has led to a lack of regular physical activity for the past two to three months. However, I recently noticed that my physical fitness has been declining, and I have been struggling during physical activities. During my last InBody and BMI measurements, I found that my body fat percentage and BMI were borderline acceptable. 

Therefore, I have decided to implement this system and start exercising while monitoring my health condition regularly.

`Hope I can be more HEALTHY!!!`
